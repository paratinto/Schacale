  'On 2007-jun-17, Daniel Compos noted that for Gambas v 1.9.49+:
  '   Put the "Async" PROPERTY set TO FALSE prior TO Get(), that way
  '   Get() will STOP the program flow UNTIL all the information IS
  '   received. In that CASE you should USE also the "TimeOut" PROPERTY TO
  '   set a timeout, IF NOT, it could hang forvever IF the server does NOT
  '   reply properly.
